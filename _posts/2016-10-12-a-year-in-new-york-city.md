I moved to New York City about a year ago, taking a postdoctoral-level position at the American Museum of Natural History. This was a big change for me for several reasons. Firstly, I had been living abroad in Chile for four years. Second, I was moving away from research and this position, nominally called project manager, offered an alternative to the pure research positions that seemed expected of me. Third, I did not have a clear plan for my future and worried about my shift in career. Finally, NYC is a world on its own and even a year in, it can still be daunting.  
  
In this post, I wanted to just briefly talk about my experiences over the past year and how I've changed.  
  
  
  
**Moving to NYC**  
I was excited to move to New York since I felt like Chile was not my home. While I had residency there, I did not have long term plans to stay there and felt like half my life was abroad. Moving back to the US felt great, however, I was quickly hit by a bit of a reverse culture shock, partly from the US and partly from NYC. I lived in a very nice, very spacious apartment in Chile with nearly unobstructed views of the Andes mountains. I also lived in a very nice part of town, with clean streets and easy access to decent places to eat. The only things I had to worry about were smog and dust, really. There was no way I could afford to live anywhere comparably nice in NYC. Some weeks I'm just depressed as I look out my window to a brick wall or go outside and step around trash and dead rats on my way to work. The constant noise, usually from neighbors, can also be annoying. Maybe I could have lived in a nicer neighborhood if I had looked for a smaller place or shared with someone, but coming from abroad with only a few weeks to search I had to grab the best option I could find.  
  
It hasn't all been bad, though. I've come to grips that NYC is simply dirty in comparison to many other places, but it has plenty of good to offset that. I love that the subway runs all the time, even if there are frequent delays and changes. Back in Chile, you had to make sure to catch the final 11pm trains or else you had to take the buses and taxis (which to be fair, were very cheap). While Santiago had its fair share of greenery, I feel that NYC's are larger and more concentrated. It's always refreshing to spend a few minutes walking along Central Park or Fort Tryon and it's really convenient to get to these parks. There's also plenty of good food in NYC, if you're in the right neighborhoods.  
  
I also like that there's so much going on in NYC. Every few months I would go and plan out things to do for a few weekends in a row and quickly get overwhelmed with all the options. Sometimes, I had to juggle various cool events all happening the same day. I've been to food festivals, movie screenings, museums, and even attended this year's Comic Con. As an introvert, I usually aim at more quiet time, but it's good that there's nearly always something to do if I wanted to go out.  
  
**Embracing my Job**  
I work at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) for the Brown Dwarfs in NYC research team (BDNYC). While I don't strictly do research anymore, I still advise the students and help out with their projects. I've built web applications for the team and have, in my opinion, significantly improved on the way they access their database, not to mention helping curate the contents of said database as well. I've also helped with adding data to the Digital Universe, for presentation in our planetarium and for creating press release videos. These days I'm very excited to be working with the GAIA data as it should lead to some great presentations. I've been very happy with my time at the museum and have made some friends there. At first, I was reserved and was hesitant to describe my place there. When asked what I worked on, I didn't have a clear answer given the broad variety of things I do and felt ashamed of not doing research. These days I feel better about my place there and working at the museum has opened up my eyes to other careers that I would not have normally considered.  
  
**Exploring Data Science**  
One of the reasons I went to NYC was to explore the world of Data Science. I had taken some courses on the topic and on coding with R, but it felt like to break into that job market I needed to be better placed- in the US and preferably in a big city. During this past year, I attended another workshop on Data Science with R and that taught me a lot about what the field is like and what I needed to brush up on. Some days I feel I have all that it takes for a success Data Science career, others I'm overwhelmed at all I still have to learn. I've also taken to doing a few hobby projects to practice and hone my skills. Some of those are in Kaggle, but most I post here as content for my blog. These have been very fun and I'll probably continue these from time to time regardless of where I end up working. While I still have the Data Science option in mind, I'm also looking more broadly at astronomy-related careers in database management so I feel I have plenty of options to consider.  
  
**The Future**  
At this point, my future is still uncertain. I've applied to some jobs and am hopeful for them, but I still have some time at the museum. Exactly where I end up and what I end up doing remains to be seen.
