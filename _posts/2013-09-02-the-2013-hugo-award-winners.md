I woke up this morning to the news of the Hugo Awards. These are arguably some of the most prestigious awards a science fiction or fantasy book (or related work) can get. I had not paid close attention this year, but I'm pleasantly surprised to see several books/novellas I've read have won.  
  
For Best Novel, John Scalzi's [Redshirts](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/06/book-review-redshirts-by-john-scalzi.html) took the prize. Scalzi always has this humorous style that's fun to read.  
For Best Novella, Brandon Sanderson's [The Emperor's Soul](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/12/novella-review-emperors-soul-by-brandon.html) took the prize. This was a good novella that managed in a short time to convey a full world and epic story.  
  
My congratulations to the authors and to the many others that won or were nominated this year. A full list of the nominees and winners can be found in Tor's [website](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/09/announcing-the-2013-hugo-award-winners).
