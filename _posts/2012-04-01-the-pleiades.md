The Pleiades is an open cluster of stars located in the constellation of Taurus, the Bull. It is also known as the Seven Sisters and as Subaru (in Japan).

Over X stars are in the Pleiades, though to see that many one requires a modest sized telescope. In addition, the farther you get from the core of the Pleiades, the trickier it is to disentangle true members from contaminants.

To date, only two Pleiades stars are known to host brown dwarf companions. Brown dwarfs are failed stars that do not have enough mass to initiate Hydrogen fusion in their cores. They straddle the boundary between stars and planets. This makes them very useful objects to study for research involving giant extrasolar planets as well as low-mass star formation. Free-floating brown dwarfs, that is, brown dwarfs not associated to a star, where previously known in the Pleiades, but these two are bound to a sun-like star.
