A few weeks ago I posted this horrible picture of the Eastern view from my apartment:

This was around sunset, but the Sun sets in the west, so it's more of an anti-sunset picture. The picture fails to capture the eerie red glow from all the haze and smog (and clouds).  
  
Today, I am pleased to offer you a similar view at about the same time of day:

As you can probably tell, conditions are _much_ better. There's been some wind today and the views are very clear.
