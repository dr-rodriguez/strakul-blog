You don't need to be an extragalactic astronomer to find the video below amazing.  
This 17-minute video walks you through the distribution and velocities of galaxies within 300 million [light-years](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/02/distances-in-astronomy.html) of the Milky Way Galaxy. Distinct regions like the Virgo Cluster, the Local Void, and the Great Wall are easily seen and pointed out by the video. There's a lot of rotations going on, and the field of galaxies is complex, but the video does a good job of highlighting what's important at each step so that one is not completely overwhelmed. It's great to see where all these structures are and be reminded of how large the Universe is, as I tend to deal with stars that are a million times closer.
