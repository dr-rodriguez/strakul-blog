This book pretty much immediately follows [The Hands of the Emperor](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2022/04/book-review-hands-of-emperor-by.html) and while it is very different in scope and tone, you can consider it a bit of a sequel and should start with the former.

_Artorin Damara is the Last Emperor of Astandalas and present Lord Magus of Zunidh. He is respected as a great mage, revered as a living god, regarded as the embodiment of power and wealth and majesty. Few have seen him in anything but the most resplendent garments; fewer still have ever looked him in the eyes._

_He is possibly the last person you would expect to find breaking into the tomb of the first Emperor of Astandalas. He could, after all, have entered it legitimately._

Read on for my spoiler-free review.

#### Overall Impression

This was an interesting book, sort of a travelogue. While starting with the Emperor's quest, we pivot over to an even more legendary character- Fitzroy Angursell himself. The relationship between him and the Emperor is quite unique and central to the story. There are quite a few memorable characters and lively plot events, though not at the same level as the prior novel. The setting, though offers a bit more exploration into the mysteries of the Nine Worlds with a deeper look into its magic.

#### Plot

The story starts with the Emperor's quest to search for his successor. That was the premise behind a lot of the preparations behind [The Hands of the Emperor](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2022/04/book-review-hands-of-emperor-by.html), so it great to see a continuation of that arc. However, very quickly on we meet Fitzroy Angursell and get some interesting mysteries revealed. From there on, we follow the story of Fitzroy instead as he journeys to find friends and some particular artifacts to aid him in his quest.

The only thing that I disliked about the story was that seemed to be too many coincidences. Characters arrive just in the nick of time, right before some big quest or event is about to take place. While this occurring once or twice isn't bad, there are just a few too many for my tastes that it felt a bit ridiculous. Nevertheless, the plot was decently paced and had some great moments in it. It felt a little bit like a travelogue as the characters go from place to place, meet new people, solve problems, and move on. A lot of backstory is hinted at for even the secondary characters and I've heard other novels and short stories cover them.

#### Characters

Chief in this story is Fitzroy Angursell, the legendary poet and member of the Red Company. We also get to see a few other members of the Company and hear what they've been up to. There are some powerful emotional moments between the Company members and Fitzroy. Many have changed since the last time they saw each other and Fitzroy himself has changed even more thanks to his long imprisonment. Some of the stories of the Red Company seem purely fantastical or exaggerated. It's somewhat weird to see legendary heroes talking about their exploits many years after the fact- most stories tend to focus on the journey of those characters as they start out.

#### Setting / World Building

While the prior book may have centered on the Emperor's palace in Solaara and Kip's home in the Vangavaye-ve, here we get to see more of the Empire. We see the worlds of Zunidh and Alinor, with crazy things going on like sky forests (they are actually flying trees!) and a city hidden from the world and from time itself. We also get to see a lot more wild magic as well as mythical creatures that may or may not be gods.

The nature of the separate worlds is still a bit vague for me. It sounds like sometimes you can sail or walk from one to another, while other times you need actual magic. Are they separate planets or separate continents? Regardless, this is a book that focuses on character interactions rather than physical realities, but it's still nice to have these intricate settings and the hints of even more mysteries beyond.

#### Final Thoughts

This was a pretty fun book. While not as impactful as [The Hands of the Emperor](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2022/04/book-review-hands-of-emperor-by.html) it was still enjoyable. Fitzroy is a particularly chaotic character, in sharp contrast with the meticulous and orderly Kip. It was clear even to me that Fitzroy has changed a lot, compared to all the legends alluded to in this book and the prior. The reconciliation of his past, present, and future is a bit of a theme and plays out with his interactions with old and new friends. Goddard's knack for powerful emotional encounters is a key driver to the plot. I look forward to her upcoming book,  _At the Feet of the Sun_ , for even more adventures!
