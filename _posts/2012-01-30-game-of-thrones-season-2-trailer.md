Everyone is talking about it: the trailer for season 2 of Game of Thrones is out. The season premiere is April 1 for the US, at least. Here is the YouTube video for those few who haven't seen it yet:  


  
Season 1 neatly covered the events in Book 1 (**A Game of Thrones**) of **A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin**. I'm sure all of us hope that season 2 will be likewise faithful to the second book- **A Clash of Kings**. Even if there are substantial differences, I know HBO will produce an amazing second season worthy to watch and remember.  
  
Westeros has [screen grabs](http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Gallery/Entry/3137/) from the trailer with comments on what we are seeing.
