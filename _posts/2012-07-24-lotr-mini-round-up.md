[![](http://cdn3.blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/files/covers/20.jpg)](http://cdn3.blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/files/covers/20.jpg)It's been a while since I posted anything, so here's a short post gathering a few interesting things related to **The Lord of the Rings** and **The Hobbit** by J.R.R. Tolkien.  
  
On July 24 1954, 58 years ago today, **The Fellowship of the Ring** was first published. As many of you know, this is the first part of The Lord of the Rings and I would consider it a classic of modern literature.  
  
They say you should never judge a book by it's cover. You should also never, ever, try to guess the plot of a book by the cover. Yet, [this 6-year old girl](http://blogs.babble.com/strollerderby/2012/07/12/judging-a-book-by-its-cover-a-6-year-old-guesses-what-classic-novels-are-all-about/#the-fellowship-of-the-rings) was asked to for several classics in science fiction and fantasy. Here's what she has to say regarding the cover for The Fellowship of the Ring:  
_This book is about a tree on a hill. The tree is the star of the book and it’s a very nice tree but everyone else is mean. I think the tree has a magical ring and some evil guys capture the ring and put him on the top of the hill so they can watch him._  
  
  
Last but not least: we're getting closer to The Hobbit film!  
Here is the latest video blog with some tidbits about Comic Con and the final stages of filming:  


  
I have a feeling that many Tolkien purists will be dissatisfied with the film. A lot is being added that isn't in the original story. It's going to feel less like The Hobbit and more like a The Lord of the Rings prequel. I personally have no problem with that since I enjoyed the prior films. This will be an amazing visit back to good old Middle Earth.
