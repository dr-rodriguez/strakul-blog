This may be old news for some, but Tor has [revealed the cover](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2012/05/michael-whelans-cover-for-a-memory-of-light-revealed) for the final book of the Wheel of Time, **A Memory of Light** by Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson:

In my opinion, this is one of the best covers to date for the series. It's done by a different artist, Michael Whelan, who is well known in the community and has created many fabulous book covers (for example, see The Stormlight Archives #1: [The Way of Kings](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2010/03/micahel-whelans-cover-for-brandon-sanders-the-way-of-kings) by Brandon Sanderson). All the prior Wheel of Time covers were done by Darrell Sweet, but sadly he passed away in December before finishing his sketch for the cover:

If you own a Kindle or other e-reader, you may want to use the new Whelan cover as your background/wallpaper/screensaver, so you can pretend you're reading the final book of the series well ahead of everyone! I searched, but couldn't find that anyone had converted the cover (a trivial process), so here you go:

You can download the 600x800 version [here](https://picasaweb.google.com/107352926946754821853/Misc#5740688663887266322) (from the Picasa album).  
Instructions for how to set it up on your device will vary, but [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/37424/jailbreak-your-kindle-for-dead-simple-screensaver-customization/) is some useful information one for the Kindle.  
  
If you prefer Sweet's version (with the title/authors added by [Aidan Moher](http://aidanmoher.com/blog/2012/04/art/cover-art/cover-art-for-a-memory-of-light-by-robert-jordan-and-brandon-sanderson/)) here you go:

You can download the 600x800 version [here](https://picasaweb.google.com/107352926946754821853/Misc#5740694286703686578). It looks a bit grainier since the original size was smaller than this. I personally prefer the Whelan cover.
