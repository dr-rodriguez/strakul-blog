Back in high school I dabbled in some poetry some time before the first of the Lord of the Rings movies came out. I wrote four epic poems set in that world (with some liberties at time). I'll be posting them here when I find I haven't posted in a while. I am not a poet, so I don't think these are great, but perhaps you'll disagree?  
  
Here is the first of them.  
  


The Fellowship

  


Ancient texts I found

And in them they abound

Stories of a ring

And the sword of a king.

  


My lands I left

For the sword to get

To ensure our victory

And go down in history.

  


After reaching Rivendell

Where the wise elves dwell,

I found the sword I sought

And the ring that was wrought.

  


Meeting Frodo the halfling

I could see he had the ring;

I was filled with burning desire,

The ring I would acquire.

  


Kneeling to his head,

This to Frodo I said:

“My service I will lend

'tis you who I’ll defend.”

  


The ring they would destroy,

Yet this I would not enjoy;

I proposed something instead,

This to Elrond I said:

“The weapon is a gift,

Great shadows we would lift

If we would use the ring,

Who knows what good we’ll bring?”

  


“Boromir, you are wrong;

None of us is strong

To wield the ring

And the power it will bring”

Was Elrond’s reply

Whom I would not defy.

And just as I expected

A fellowship was selected.

  


After preparing our horses

We set of in combined forces

Thus our journey we started

And from Rivendell departed.

  


Away we were sent

And down south we went,

When at Caradhras we arrived

I felt we wouldn’t survive.

  


Up the mountain we climbed

But we were ill timed,

For winter had brought snow

And the winds forth would blow

  


The mountain we could not pass

And were turned back, alas.

And to Moria we went

As was now our intent.

  


We reached the entrance in fact,

Yet the secret word we lacked;

We heard a wolf’s howl

As near us they would prowl.

  


The door would not yield

Until Gandalf revealed

The secret word or phrase

That would open up this maze.

  


And friend it was

The word that let us pass,

So we entered Khazad-dûm

Where Gandalf met his doom.

  


In the silence, we heard feet

In the darkness, eyes would peek;

We walked in constant fear

For something fey drew near.

  


As Moria we crossed

And before Gandalf was lost,

We entered the domain

Of the evil Durin’s Bane.

  


This creature of evil

Make Gandalf look feeble,

Yet over a pit

Gandalf resisted it.

  


So he said: “You shall not pass!”

And the bridge broke like glass,

Yet as the Balrog fell

On to Gandalf he held.

  


Out of Moria we ran

To later make our plan,

Aragorn now led

And to Lórien we head.

  


We entered the wood

And before the Lady stood,

To ask for her aid

For our faithful crusade.

  


On this I don’t lie

She gave us supply

To last for a year

And guard us from fear.

  


Some time we spent

Yet away we went,

And though filled with dread

To the falls we sped.

  


When Frodo was alone

And with understanding tone,

The ring I would demand

I would take it from his hand.

  


The ring I would take

And this was my mistake,

He would not heed my threat

And away from us he set.

  


And so Frodo ran

As fast as any Hobbit can,

But then he wore the ring

And no more was he seen.

  


An orc party came;

Hobbits they would claim.

Merry and Pippin I defended

And it was then that I ended.

  


Those two were taken

And I was so shaken,

For many a dart

Had pierced my heart.

  


I sounded my horn,

But I was forlorn

Until Aragorn came

Much to my shame.

  


I told him what had befallen

How to the ring I had fallen;

Now that Frodo had fled

This to Aragorn I said:

“I will die here today,

I curse this fateful day;

I tried to take the ring from him

Now the future seems dark and grim.”

  


With sadness in my heart

This world I would depart;

I took my last breath,

Surrendering to death.
