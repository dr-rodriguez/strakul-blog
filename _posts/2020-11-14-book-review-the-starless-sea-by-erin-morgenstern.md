**The Starless Sea** by Erin Morgenstern came highly recommended from a good friend of mine who lent me her copy. She was not wrong, this book is so interesting in so many unexpected ways. I haven't read **The Night Circus** either, but that was also highly recommended. 

Read on for my spoiler-free review.

**Overall Impression**

Ambience is the one word I would use to describe this book. The setting is so prevalent that I ended up wanting to read just to feel like I was in the Harbor by the Starless Sea, amidst the books reading by quiet, warm candlelight. Of course, it wasn't all soothing, there is danger as the characters struggle against forces they don't entirely understand, bringing a mythic scope to the plot alongside tangled romances. Overall, this was a rewarding book to be read slowly and ponder all its intricate connections.

**Plot**

This was a fairly slow read for me, mainly due to the way the novel is structured and the heavy emphasis of the setting. Between almost every 'story' chapter there is a small vignette with another story, usually of a more fairy tale nature. These vignettes were incredible and I enjoyed every one of them. They help cement the setting and break the pace of the story to a more leisurely stroll. Even better, despite the seeming disconnect as you progress in the story you start seeing links between the actual plot and the vignettes and it becomes a race to see if you can figure out how things tie together. At that point, the pace quickens and you start getting a lot of cool things happening as all the stories clash together.

**Characters**

There are a handful of interesting, unique characters in this book, but the one we follow almost exclusively is Zachary Ezra Rawlins. He is a young man who loves story telling, in both books and video gaming. I found it fascinating to read about a gamer and it was very clear that he approached problems and situations with that perspective in mind. It was a refreshing change from the typical protagonists in many of the stories I've read. Other notable characters include Dorian and Mirabel. They, alongside some of the other characters, are enigmatic and mysterious in their own ways, and part of the novel is discovering out just what everyone is.

**Setting / World Building**

The setting is really the highlight of the book. It is a magical and mysterious place and part of the charm is you as the reader discovering how things work alongside the characters. Without spoiling too much, imagine a hidden library, deep underground, with old books, cats, secret rooms and alcoves, and many doors. All is silent and warm and cozy, with a glowing sea in the dark horizon.

Again, without spoiling much, it was also nice to see the little fairy tales in the vignettes. These were very well told, I could totally imagine them being real tales forgotten by time. Some of the aspects there, of Time, Fate, the Starless Sea, the Owl King and the symbolism of bees, keys, and swords, were very cool and the subject of much discussion with my friend while I was progressing through the narrative. While parts of the book are indeed a love story; to me, it felt like the romance was more with the setting and the ideas behind story telling.

**Final Thoughts**

This was an incredible book and one I can highly recommend. It is a very different story than the ones I tend to read, full of mystery, magic, and a lot of love for books and story telling. The characters were interesting and the plot had a pleasant, non-hectic pace. The setting, though, was amazing and engrossing. I look forward to reading **The Night Circus** at some point to see if this also has a similar style.
