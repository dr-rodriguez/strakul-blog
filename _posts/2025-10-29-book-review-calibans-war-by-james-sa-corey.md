**Caliban's War** is the second book in The Expanse series by James S.A. Corey. This one, and [Leviathan Wakes](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2025/08/book-review-leviathan-wakes-by-james-sa.html), had been the only novels I had read prior to watching all of the TV show. Here is the Goodreads blurb for this second book:

_We are not alone in this universe._

_On Ganymede, the station that represents the main food source for exoplanets, a Martian marine sergeant watches her entire platoon being slaughtered before her eyes by a supernatural monster. On Earth, a high-ranking politician struggles to defuse an interplanetary war. Meanwhile, an alien protomolecule sweeps across Venus, causing profound and mysterious changes and threatening to spread and sweep across the solar system._

_In the vastness of space, James Holden and the crew of the Rocinante maintain the stability of the exoplanetary alliance. When he and his crew agree to help a scientist search for his missing daughter on war-torn Ganymede, the fate of humanity hinges on whether one craft can prevent an alien invasion that may already be underway._

Read on for my spoiler-free review.

#### Overall Impression

This was a good book and exciting continuation of The Expanse series. A lot of new characters are introduced, which helps keep things fresh. The plot is interesting and more straightforward compared to the prior novel. The broader scope is also a good touch as we get to see more from Earth and Mars which were somewhat in the background of the first book despite being such pivotal players. There's a lot more subtlety to the characters and the political situation than the TV series can offer.

#### Plot

There are several key plot lines in this book. The attack on Ganymede is witnessed both by Bobbie, from the Martian point of view, and by Prax from the Belter point of view. That kicks off the whole conflict and starts involving more people. One aspect that is a bit weaker in the book is the political machinations. They are present, but I feel they were presented maybe more impactfully in the TV series, perhaps since some things happen entirely off-camera in the book but are shown in the TV series. Regardless, the plot is fun and generally fast-paced. The ending feels like a prolonged epilogue until you see the real ending and the cliffhanger with it. It's actually quite satisfying. 

#### Characters

A lot of the same characters, namely Holden's crew, are present in this story. Notable additions are some external characters, like Undersecretary Avasarala, Seargent Bobbie Draper, and Dr. Praxidike Meng. These are pretty cool characters and bring about some different perspectives to the whole situation and insights beyond Holden's team. In the TV series, Avasarala appears far earlier- in the first season based on the first book, which makes sense if you want to show the more political nature of the conflict at large. One thing that's easy to forget is that the lower gravity of Mars and other stations leads to taller people. Bobbie is far taller in the books than in the TV series, a combination of her Polynesian heritage and the lower Martian gravity.

#### Setting / World Building

This is set in the same universe as the other Expanse novels. There are ongoing tensions between Earth, Mars, and the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA). The prior book had paused the conflict, but tensions were still high and they quickly flare up again. This is a subtle difference from the TV series which seems to show the conflict developing more slowly as the characters go about doing their things. In the book, there is more emphasis on how long space travel actually is so characters may spend weeks in downtime travel which means the conflict has enough time to develop and escalate.

The protomolecule continues to be an enigma. We probably get more information in the book than the TV series as it's able to present more details without overwhelming the reader. Despite being the boogeyman of the series, in this book the conflict between the various planets is still the main focus.

#### Final Thoughts

Overall, this was a pretty good book. I like how we get a larger cast of characters and a broader perspective for the situation. The TV series does a better job of keeping characters in the spotlight, but it also benefits from a more visual medium and lacks some of the subtleties of character thoughts. I'm curious to see if the books and TV continue to be so closely aligned.
