Artist depiction of Kepler 62f  
  
In the latest astronomy-related news, a pair of planets in the habitable zone of a distant star has been found by NASA's Kepler spacecraft. Tons of newspapers and websites are reporting on [Kepler 62](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/science/space/2-new-planets-are-most-earth-like-yet-scientists-say.html). We already have several promising planets in the habitable zones of other stars, but it's a good thing to excite the public's interest in such topics. In our current times of budget cuts, it's important to emphasize the role science and astronomy have in our lives and our culture.  
  
In addition to the reports on the planetary system, the New York Times released [an impressive visualization/infographic](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/space/keplers-tally-of-planets.html?_r=0) of many of the Kepler planets discovered to date. It's very much like the older [Kepler orrery](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/10/exoplanet-visualizations.html), but this one is interactive so you can see extra information on the system like the name, any artist conception, or any article associated with it. Go [check it out](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/space/keplers-tally-of-planets.html?_r=0)!
