Here is today's anti-sunset picture:

As I've mentioned [before](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2012/01/chilean-anti-sunset-1182012.html), my view faces East so I can't really see the setting Sun. What I see is the Sun illuminating the Andes and the clouds in the sky. One of these days I'll show you a sunrise, that should be far cooler. I'll probably wait until winter, though, so ~~I don't have to wake up as early~~ the mountains are snow covered. In the meantime, enjoy the anti-sunset.
