This month marks a year since I started my job at Space Telescope. I'm having a great time working there and living in Baltimore, so I figured I'd write a post about some of the things I've done since.  
  
**Working at Space Telescope**  
One of the main things I've learned since working as an Archive Scientist is that there is no one definition of what an archive scientist is or does. Each of us does something different, which makes describing our jobs so difficult. On my end, I focus on building catalogs, such as the Guide Star Catalog, as well as consolidating metadata from our various missions into a single database. I also have my fingers in a few other projects relating to contributed products, future missions, and Portal projects. I'm on the more technical/software development side than most of the other archive scientists in our branch with plenty of database development work, yet I'm nowhere near as skilled as our software developers or database administrators.  
  
When I started, I learned a lot of T-SQL to get sped up quickly in my early work adding entries to the Guide Star Catalog. Later on, I took some advanced courses in Python, which while mostly review did serve to highlight how I could better use Classes and decorators to improve my workflow. I've since been working to add unit tests to our main metadata code and I'm so glad I did this since it's helped me catch countless error and keep the various branches of our code all agreeing with what they should be doing.  
  
Our branch has also finally moved to our new building- the Rotunda. I was informed when I started that this would be happening soon, but it took nearly a year for it to happen. I for one am glad for the move. My office is nicer and newer, the branch is now all together, and the Muller building was getting crowded, especially whenever there was a conference or workshop at STScI. A drawback is that I might not see random friends visiting the institute quite as often, since they'd be unlikely to be visiting the Rotunda. Also, the food trucks that were part of the Rotunda are not allowed to be there any more, yet not all of the restaurants have opened up. I think we end up winning, though, in terms of meal variety. My bus routes have changed a bit, but it looks like I may have a single line that now stops directly in front of the Rotunda. It's less frequent, but more convenient.  
  
**Living in Baltimore**  
I still think Baltimore is a pretty neat city. I'm living in downtown, which has the benefits of easy public transport connections and lots of events at the cost of somewhat higher prices and having more homeless people around. I've had the chance to try out some of the local restaurants, especially when I happen to telework from home. I've also tried to keep up to date with all the cool things happening. That has slowed down over the winter months, personally because I've been too tired and cold, but also I think I'm not the only one and events are as common. I'm looking forward to Spring and Summer where it'll be nicer out.  
  
During my time here I've gone to several festivals, including the Light City right when I was moving in (looking forward to this year's!), Artscape, Madonnari Art, and several crazy ones at Hampden; theatre performances; Cirque du Soleil; three science fiction/fantasy/comic conventions (though technically one was in New York); and more. And yet there is still more that I haven't yet explored as well as all the things happening in DC, which is a relatively short train ride away.  
  
**2017 in General**  
While I'm grateful for the cool things I was able to do and work on in the past year, I'm torn when I hear the stories of others. My home island of Puerto Rico was devastated by hurricanes this past year. Although my family is all safe, the island still has a long road to recovery and this is further hampered by local corruption and the federal government's negligence and outright exploitation of the citizens there.  
  
On the other side of things, I fear we're seeing the fall of democracy with our current administration and the rise of autocratic sympathies across the world. While I personally haven't yet read the books describing the [Strauss-Howe generational theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory), I've followed it with great interest as despite it's shortcomings it has managed to capture the cyclical nature of history and makes some vague descriptions of what should be happening in the next few years. What we're seeing with Trump's administration and the reaction of Millennials to counter it is exactly what this generational theory predicts should happen. We're moving towards a paradigm shift in America's view of itself and others and it's scary to think so much uncertainty awaits us.  
  
Not to end on a somber note, but I have high hopes for the rest of 2018 and look forward to more exciting developments both at work and in Baltimore.
