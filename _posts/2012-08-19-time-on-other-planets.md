The saying goes: if you have a watch you know what time it is, if you have two you are never sure.

On the Earth, it is midnight right now... somewhere. The current local time depends primarily on longitude. This is why timezones are arranged that way. As you move East or West, the time changes if you measure it by the position of the Sun or the stars at that location. Hence, it could be midnight in Los Angeles locally, but in New York it's 3 am.  
We can disregard this complexity (as well as issues of daylight savings time) if we just use a single time for the Earth- Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), which is effectively the same as Greenwich Mean Time. The time at your location can be found by adding or subtracting hours (and a few cases half-hours) from UTC. However, this is not intended to be a discussion on the time on Earth so we'll take it as a given that we know what time it is on Earth.  
  
None of the other planets in our solar system has been explored as heavily as Mars, hence we don't have (or need) a way to tell what time it is there. If and when we do explore these other worlds, we'll have to consider what is 0-time and whether or not we will use Earth-time there or use the system's rotation period.
