This book came highly recommended from a good friend of mine and caught me at a good time when I wanted to try something new. I had heard about it, but hadn't really committed to reading it. I am glad I did. Here's the Goodreads blurb for some context:

_An impulsive word can start a war.  
A timely word can stop one.  
A simple act of friendship can change the course of history.  
  
Cliopher Mdang is the personal secretary of the Last Emperor of Astandalas, the Lord of Rising Stars, the Lord Magus of Zunidh, the Sun-on-Earth, the god.  
He has spent more time with the Emperor of Astandalas than any other person.  
He has never once touched his lord.  
He has never called him by name.  
He has never initiated a conversation.  
  
One day Cliopher invites the Sun-on-Earth home to the proverbially remote Vangavaye-ve for a holiday.  
  
The mere invitation could have seen Cliopher executed for blasphemy.  
The acceptance upends the world._

Read on for my spoiler-free review.

#### Overall Impression

#### 

This book was absolutely incredible. I had a hard time putting it down and kept messaging my friend as I reached certain points in the story. Characters are king in this book, with Kip and the Emperor's relationship being a central driver to the story. The setting is also very intriguing with a mix of island culture and a splash of high fantasy. The plot, while sometimes slow, is relaxing. I actually felt I was on vacation while the characters were also having their holiday. 

Plot

#### 

This is a book whose plot meanders and has almost no clear direction. At a glance, it doesn't appear it should work but it does because the story is not about the plot but about character relationships. It is the interplay of characters, their ambitions, feelings, desires, that provide tension and drive the story forward. This is evident in some of the pacing and how much time is dedicated to some events. For example, establishing universal basic income for all people- a few paragraphs spread across a chapter or two; having a holiday with his friends- easily a dozen or so chapters heavily tied together. There is a lot of subtle humor throughout the character interactions which will have you grinning or laughing out right with them. The book's plot is just relaxing when it needs to be and a refreshing change from the standard 'formula' used in so many others. A lot of the chapters felt like episodes of a humorous sitcom- The One Where They Fix a Harp, The One Where They Visit a Museum, The One Where Kip Goes to the Bank.

Characters

#### 

Central to the story is the secretary Cliopher "Kip" Mdang and his relationship to the Sun-on-Earth, the Last Emperor of Astandalas. We see the world entirely through Kip's eyes, but when he is not with family and childhood friends, his world revolves entirely around the Emperor (and let's be fair- even with family it still does). The story is driven by his evolving relationship and how he comes to grip with his feelings and ambitions and how he balances his cultural heritage, his family, and the demands of the imperial court. It really helps that the characters are so well made and that there are so many moments and opportunities for them to interact in different ways.

#### Setting / World Building

#### 

When I started reading this book, I expected it to be nonfiction but not fantastical. I was wrong, there is actually magic in this series. The magic, however, is all very much in the background. Magic is used to assist in the travel and communication across the world as well as in minor things like powering lights or sealing documents. There is a connection between the stability of the magic of the world and the Sun-on-Earth, but the book only lightly explores it. If anything, you are left wondering how much of the rituals and taboos are real and powered by magic and how many of them are just simple traditions.

One of the interesting aspects of the setting, that is referred to constantly, is the Fall. Exactly what that is and what happened around it is slowly revealed, but in short it was a cataclysmic event and reshaped many peoples lives. I particularly liked how it seems that time flowed differently in the days after the Fall, and it's certainly confusing when characters like Kip refers to hundreds of years passing when he is younger than that.

The non-magical aspects of the setting heavily revolve around the Vangavaye-ve, Kip's home. This is heavily influenced by Polynesian culture and it's fascinating to see that juxtaposed against high fantasy tropes and the nuances of modern bureaucracy and imperial colonization.

#### Final Thoughts

This was a powerful, wholesome story full of vibrant characters and subtle magic. I want to see where the story takes Kip, the Emperor, and their friends next. The characters, their growth, their relationships, and their place in the world is really what drives this story. For me, it hit some personal notes as I am also from an island and left it and my family to pursue my ambitions, many of which my family doesn't understand. To see Kip facing similar (albeit also very different) challenges made it all the more relevant. I have heard that this has similarities to The Goblin Emperor which has been on my to-read list for far too long!
