A new year, a new set of books to read. This past year, I read 12 books, consistent with [the prior year](https://strakul.blogspot.com/2016/12/favorite-books-of-2016.html), though I managed longer books. In total, [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2017/4610553) claims I read 7400 pages. As usual, I like to point out what the best books I read in 2017 are. Note however, that these are books I *read* in 2017, not necessarily that were *published* in 2017. So, without further ado, here are my top 3 books this year.  
  
3\. [Lord of Light](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2017/06/book-review-lord-of-light-by-roger.html) by Roger Zelazny  
  
On my list for years and unable to find it at local bookstores, I finally decided to order it online and read it. This 1968 Hugo-award winner is highly regarded and the blurb is both cryptic and enticing. This is a futuristic story in a far away colony world where advanced technology has allowed a selected few to become as powerful as gods. They've taken the names and aspects of Hindu gods and used that influence to subjugate their people. Until, that is, one stands against them:  _he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons, Lord of Light._  
  
2\. [Oathbringer](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2017/12/book-review-oathbringer-by-brandon.html) by Brandon Sanderson  
  
Readers of my blog will be familiar with my love for Sanderson's books. This year saw the release of the third book in **The Stormlight Archive** , a massive epic series that feels ready to challenge the best epic fantasies out there. This is not your typical medieval fantasy, this is something new in a masterfully crafted world with intriguing magic and mysteries around every corner. It'll probably be about 2 years before the next volume in the series, but at 1200 pages, this one is long enough to keep you satisfied... for a bit.  
  
1\. [The Stone Sky](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2017/09/book-review-stone-sky-by-nk-jemisin.html) by N.K. Jemisin

N.K. Jemisin is a talented author that writes exciting, genre-defying stories that at the same time are blended with contemporary social issues. I got into **The Broken Earth** trilogy around the time the second book was released, and this book marks the end of the trilogy. It's a fascinating series with geological-based magic I haven't seen before as well as characters that are as real as they are broken. You cheer them for their successes and weep at their failures, all as the skies grow darker and world dies around them. It is a dark novel for dark times that keeps you thinking and wondering long after you've finished it.
