Short post today to point out Emily Rice's excellent work compiling a parody video of Call Me, Maybe. This was a hackAAS project at the most recent [American Astronomical Society meeting](http://strakul.blogspot.com/2013/01/astronomy-221th-american-astronomical.html).  
You have to see this; it's excellent. And as a bonus, I appear briefly near the end!
