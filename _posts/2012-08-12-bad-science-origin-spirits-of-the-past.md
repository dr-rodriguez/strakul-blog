Every so often I hear or read articles about the bad science in movies. For example, recently Phil Plait, the Bad Astronomer, [talked](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2012/08/11/get-your-badastro-to-mars/) about how some Mars film get most of the science wrong. I'm sure we can all call up a movie or two (or three) where the scientist in us cringes at what's being depicted. To be fair: I'm happy to suspend my disbelief for the sake of a great story. It's good when the science is accurate, but the important thing in books and movies is the story itself.  
  
Today, I'm writing about an anime movie I saw a several years ago. I actually enjoyed the movie for several reasons. Unfortunately, the science is completely thrown out the window on at least two occasions.
