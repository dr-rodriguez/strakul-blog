For the past few years, Suvudu has run a tournament pitting memorable characters from science fiction and fantasy against each other to find out who is the Cage Match Champion. This year is no different and they've just [announced the lineup](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/02/cage-match-2012-the-bracket-revealed.html) for the coming competitions. I encourage you to take a look. Voting begins March 5th!  
  
One of the cool things about these cage matches, which is obviously their intent, is that you get introduced to characters you've never heard before and encouraged to read about them. I can honestly say that this resulted in **The Name of the Wind** and **The Malazan Book of the Fallen** moving up higher on my to-read list (last year Quick Ben of Malazan won and the prior year Kvothe ended up third). Characters from those two books/series are back again- Bast and Anomander Rake. Anomander is absolutely awesome in Malazan (at least up to book 3, where I'm currently at), so I (and many others) will definitely be cheering him on. This year, I must check out Peter V. Brett's **The Warded Man** (the cover for the sequel, **The Desert Spear** , initially drew me in). His character, Jardir, is facing off against Lady Jessica of **Dune**. Apparently, Jardir is also a desert warrior so the organizers were very excited for it. I'm also happy that I've read the first book of Brent Weeks' **Night Angel Trilogy** as I now know who Kylar Stern is (he's facing Gimli of **The Lord of the Rings**).  
Some other characters to watch out for, in my opinion, include: Moiraine Damodred from **The Wheel of Time** , Kelsier from **Mistborn** , Tyrion Lannister from **A Song of Ice and Fire** (aka **Game of Thrones**), Richard Rahl of **The Sword of Truth** , and Mr. Wednesday from **American Gods**.  
  
The cage matches are not just about voting on some online poll. Many authors sign up to write up what they think will happen so you get to see some very cool 'fan fiction' as characters from completely different series clash against each other (I still remember how Jaime Lannister threw Hermione Granger out a window). They've also asked fans to [draw art ](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/02/cage-match-2012-call-for-art.html)for the characters. That should also be very cool.  
  
So be sure to follow along on Suvudu's [website](http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2012/02/cage-match-2012-the-bracket-revealed.html) for the news and vote for your favorite characters. May ~~Anomander Rake~~ the strongest one win!
