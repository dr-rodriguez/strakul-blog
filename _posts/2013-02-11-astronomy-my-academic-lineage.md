Genealogies, or family trees, are cool. They show you how people are related and it's sometimes interesting to trace back as far as you can or to see if you have any famous people among your bloodline. _Academic_ genealogies are no different, expect that they record the professor-student relationship. This "PhD tree" can be quite instructive to see, not only how science has progressed, but also to see who you are 'descended' from.  
I spent a little time a few days ago figuring this out for myself. After the jump: my academic genealogy.  
  
Here we go, I graduated in 2011 and my advisor was Ben Zuckerman. In a recent interview, he mentioned his advisor (Lilley) and academic grandfather (Bok) and that helped me get started. Fortunately, my genealogy quickly converged with that of another astronomer- [Piet van der Kruit](http://www.astro.rug.nl/~vdkruit/boomstam.html). He was a student of Jan Oort, which, like Bok, was a student of van Rhijn. He had traced back his tree so the rest was a matter of reading through his notes and condensing the information.  
  
So without further ado, here is my academic genealogy with a few notes here and there. The year denotes the year the PhD or equivalent was received. There's a bit of uncertainty around the Bernoulli's and things get very fuzzy near the end, but I trust that van der Kruit has gathered [accurate information](http://www.astro.rug.nl/~vdkruit/boomstam.html).
