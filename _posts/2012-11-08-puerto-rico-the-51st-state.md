What it means to become a state  
  
  
Cultural Identity  
One of the major issues that has always been raised in these elections is that of cultural identify. Puerto Ricans (Boricuas) feel very strongly about their cultural heritage and are proud to be part of it. While in PR, I may not have felt this way, but once I moved to the US I certainly felt this was a badge I could proudly wear. Even now, in Chile, where there are many varied countries represented in our department, I proudly declare to be Puerto Rican. Even though my officemate is only half-Puerto Rican, she still counts and we gladly declare our office to be 150% Puerto Rican (yes, I know the math doesn't work that way).  
  
However, one must realize that in this global environment, cultures are being blended together. You don't need to become a state to loose your identify, you can choose to do that on your own.  
The situation is not that bad, I'm sure most Puerto Ricans would retain their culture. It may mellow out a bit, but I think we are strong enough for it. Furthermore, the agreement is that Spanish can still be held as the official language and so the change would not be as significant, culturally at least, as one might expect.  
  
Economic Reality  
Remember how Puerto Rico would shoot up to the 29th most populous state and get significant political clout? Well, the reality is that you must also consider the economic situation. As mentioned previously, PR would be receiving new support as a state, just like all the other states do. It would also have to pay higher taxes on its income. PR's income however, is extremely low and unemployment is even higher than in the US. A person in the current poorest state, Mississippi, has a personal income per capita of about $30,000. Such low income means 43% of residents in Mississippi do not pay federal income taxes. For PR, the personal income per capita is only $15,000. Should PR become a state, it would become the poorest state in the US by far. There is no way it can support all the benefits it would be receiving. The money for that must come from somewhere else: other states.  
  
  
The Biggest Obstacle  
Puerto Rico cannot become a state if Congress does not approve. Right now, and perhaps for the foreseeable future, it is not in the best interests of the 50 states to welcome another member.  
  
What does the US get out of PR? A drain on its economy and a new player immediately stronger than 31 of its states. There is, unfortunately, nothing that PR can offer that it isn't already offering. You might think it would make a better tourist location or strategic in US military goals, but nothing is stopping the US from taking this.
